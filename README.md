The two jupyter-notebook routines plot the propagated cosmic-ray spectra from a single source, with relevant physically-motivated features.

GitHub_Protons_DecayingL_VariableDelta_EnDepRelease.ipynb: 
- injection dependent on time, reflected in a time-decaying luminosity function factorized in the source term of the transport equation, Q(E,t,r) = S(E)L(t)\delta(r).
- the slope of the diffusion coefficient changes with energy (or, equivalently, rigidity), according to "Tomassetti, ApJ vol. 752, n. 1 (2012)"
- the time of the injection depends on the CR-energy -- as high-energy particles can escape faster from the SN shock -- in a customizable sophisticated way
- the propagated spectra are plotted for different ages of the source.

- injection dependent on time, reflected in a time-decaying luminosity function factorized in the source term of the transport equation, Q(E,t,r) = S(E)L(t)\delta(r).
- the slope of the diffusion coefficient changes with energy (or, equivalently, rigidity), according to "Tomassetti, ApJ vol. 752, n. 1 (2012)"
- the rate of energy-loss takes into account the KN corrections at high energies solving, according to the approximation described in "Schlickeiser&Ruppel, New Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 033044"
- the time of the injection depends on the CR-energy --- as high-energy particles can escape faster from the SN shock --- in a customizable sophisticated way
- the propagated spectra are plotted for different ages of the source.
